            The&nbsp;next step would be&nbsp;for&nbsp;you to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;vision for&nbsp;what you want in&nbsp;each area of&nbsp;your
            life. This should be&nbsp;something that inspires you.
            In&nbsp;the&nbsp;grid below you will see some examples of&nbsp;peopleâ€™s vision statements to&nbsp;spark your creativity.
            You&nbsp;can use them and&nbsp;edit them to&nbsp;make them fit to&nbsp;your own areas.
